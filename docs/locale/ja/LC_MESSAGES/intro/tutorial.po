#: ../../intro/tutorial.rst:326

"While perhaps not as popular as CSS selectors, XPath expressions offer "

"The ``-O`` command-line switch overwrites any existing file; use ``-o`` "

"Lines`_::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro/tutorial.rst:477
msgid ""
"The `JSON Lines`_ format is useful because it's stream-like, you can "
"easily append new records to it. It doesn't have the same problem of JSON"
" when you run twice. Also, as each record is a separate line, you can "
"process big files without having to fit everything in memory, there are "
"tools like `JQ`_ to help doing that at the command-line."

"In small projects (like the one in this tutorial), that should be enough."

msgid ""
"Now, after extracting the data, the ``parse()`` method looks for the link"

":meth:`~scrapy.http.Response.urljoin` method (since the links can be "
"relative) and yields a new request to the next page, registering itself "
"as callback to handle the data extraction for the next page and to keep "
"the crawling going through all the pages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro/tutorial.rst:566
msgid ""
"What you see here is Scrapy's mechanism of following links: when you "

"request finishes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro/tutorial.rst:570

"Using this, you can build complex crawlers that follow links according to"

"Another interesting thing this spider demonstrates is that, even if there"
