#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:23
msgid "To enable persistence support you just need to define a *job directory* through the ``JOBDIR`` setting. This directory will be for storing all required data to keep the state of a single job (i.e. a spider run).  It's important to note that this directory must not be shared by different spiders, or even different jobs/runs of the same spider, as it's meant to be used for storing the state of a *single* job."

msgid "Keeping persistent state between batches"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:45
msgid "Sometimes you'll want to keep some persistent spider state between pause/resume batches. You can use the ``spider.state`` attribute for that, which should be a dict. There's a built-in extension that takes care of serializing, storing and loading that attribute from the job directory, when the spider starts and stops."

#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:77
msgid "For persistence to work, :class:`~scrapy.http.Request` objects must be serializable with :mod:`pickle`, except for the ``callback`` and ``errback`` values passed to their ``__init__`` method, which must be methods of the running :class:`~scrapy.spiders.Spider` class."

msgid "If you wish to log the requests that couldn't be serialized, you can set the :setting:`SCHEDULER_DEBUG` setting to ``True`` in the project's settings page. It is ``False`` by default."
