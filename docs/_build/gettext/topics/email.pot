msgid "Although Python makes sending e-mails relatively easy via the :mod:`smtplib` library, Scrapy provides its own facility for sending e-mails which is very easy to use and it's implemented using :doc:`Twisted non-blocking IO <twisted:core/howto/defer-intro>`, to avoid interfering with the non-blocking IO of the crawler. It also provides a simple API for sending attachments and it's very easy to configure, with a few :ref:`settings <topics-email-settings>`."
